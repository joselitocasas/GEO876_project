    "## Spatial Analysis of Trees in the City of Zurich\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This Programming Project addresses the spatial distribution of trees in the city of Zürich. It is studied whether the trees and their distribution varies within the different districts of the city.\n",
    "The object of this task is not to produce ground breaking insight or be particularly accurate (more on the why later) but to train python coding skills for relative newbies. The data processing and the addressing of the research questions is solved with an object-oriented programming approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Research Questions\n",
    "The following research questions have been identified and the code is developed towards answering these questions.\n",
    "The questions have been chosen in a way that the city nursery (Stadtgärtnerei) might benefit of that knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Research Questions**\n",
    "1. Which of the districts (quartiere) contains the most trees?\n",
    "This could be of relevance for city employees as to where to most resources for maintenance need to be allocated (Trimming of trees and cleaning of leaves)\n",
    "2. Which of the districts has the highest or lowest tree density?\n",
    "In fighting the urban heat island trees and parks can lessen the impact and reduce temperatures.\n",
    "3. Which of the districts has the greatest /lowest variety of tree species?\n",
    "This can be used as a proxy for biodiversity in a district. Different insect as well bird species prefer different sorts of trees. City gardeners could use this knowledge to take action foster greater biodiversity and renew the tree inventory accordingly.\n",
    "4. Which district has the oldest trees (mean of tree age)? This Knowledge could be used as to where a lot of old trees have to be replaced soon.\n",
    "5. Using bounding boxes instead of the polygons of the districts how much are is tree count beeing exaggerated by counting one tree multiple times?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "For this spatial analysis two datasets are being used.\n",
    "the first one contains the inventory of trees in Zurich. [Baumkataster](https://data.stadt-zuerich.ch/dataset/geo_baumkataster)\n",
    "\n",
    "The second dataset contains the districts of Zürich. [Vermessungsbezirke](https://data.stadt-zuerich.ch/dataset/geo_quartiere__basierend_auf_vermessungsbezirken_)\n",
    "\n",
    "Both datasets have been downloaded as json files.\n",
    "*The data has been accessed and downloaded on March 10. 2022.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methods\n",
    "To process the datafiles and representing the data, a object-oriented coding approach has been chosen.\n",
    "Following classes are being used for this task:\n",
    "- Point\n",
    "- Tree\n",
    "- Quartier\n",
    "- CSVmakr\n",
    "- Dictmakr\n",
    "\n",
    "**Point Class**\n",
    "is the lowest level class and is used to create point objects containing and x and y coordinate. These objects are further used in the classes Tree and Quartier.\n",
    "\n",
    "The json files containing the coordinates are delivered in WGS84 projection. This projection is based on degrees and thus makes it difficult for calculating areas. Therefore the coordinates are transformed to the swiss CRS CH1903+ /LV95. The transformation follows the approach of H. DUPRAZ (1992). The code used is based on the script provided by the Federal Office of Topography by A. SCHMOCKER (2014). \n",

    "\n",
    "**Tree Class**\n",
    "is used to represent the trees and their attributes. Most importantly is its location represented by a object of the point class from above. Furthermore attributes like year of planting and tree species  are used to construct these objects. This class has a report function which returns the attributes from mentioned above. The plant year is converted to age.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Quartier Class**\n",
    "is used to represent districts as objects. It takes a list of coordinates (point objects). From the list of points a bounding box is calculated which spatially encapsulates the district in a rectangle.\n",
    "This class has many methods used for the spatial analysis. These methods can be seen as way to generates attributes of the district regarding the trees it contains. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Dictmakr Class**\n",
    "is used to create a dictionary for a district containing the attributes determined with the methods from the Quartier class. This class is used to aggregate the data for further processing and export.\n",
    "\n",
    "**CSVmakr Class**\n",
    "takes a list of dictionaries created with class above and returns and saves the data in a csv file. This file can easily be shared and / or the data processed for the analysis in a different program like Excel or R.\n",
    "For the purpose of this Project we want to use the processed data right away and therefore this class also has method for creating a pandas dataframe from the dictionaries."
